## 🎯 Key Insights Derived

📈 **Operational Insights**

1. **Peak Demand Hours**: Highest ride demand occurs between 4-7 PM, with 35% higher booking rates compared to morning hours
2. **Vehicle Type Efficiency**: Premium vehicles generate 45% higher revenue per km despite 15% lower utilization rates
3. **Wait Time Impact**: Rides with wait times exceeding 8 minutes have a 62% higher cancellation rate 

💰 **Financial Insights**

1. **Revenue Optimization**: Top 10 most profitable routes contribute to 28% of total revenue
2. **Commission Structure**: Luxury vehicle categories provide 22% higher commission rates per ride
3. **Lost Revenue**: Customer cancellations account for an estimated 15% potential revenue loss

👥 **Customer Behavior Insights**

1. **Rating Patterns**: Rides with wait times under 5 minutes receive 1.2 stars higher ratings on average
2. **Loyalty Segmentation**: Platinum customers (top 25%) contribute to 60% of total revenue
3. **Payment Preferences**: Digital wallet users show 30% higher repeat booking rates

🚗 **Driver Performance Insights**

1. **Efficiency Metrics**: Top-performing drivers maintain speed efficiency scores above 85% with 4.8+ ratings
2. **Cancellation Patterns**: Driver cancellations peak during evening rush hours (5-7 PM)
3. **Earning Potential**: Drivers focusing on airport routes earn 35% more per hour than city-center drivers

⚠️ **Risk Factors Identified**

1. **Churn Indicators**: Drivers with cancellation rates above 15% show 3x higher attrition probability
2. **Service Gaps**: Specific geographic zones experience 40% longer wait times than city average
3. **Revenue Risks**: 12% of high-value customers show declining booking frequency
